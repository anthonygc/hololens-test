# hololens-test
This is a test to see if I am able to connect unity with github using github desktop.


### Goal

The goal of this project is to create a 3D experience for the Hololens. This is for the duration of my summer internship. My hopes is to be able to use this as a starting point for my **senior thesis**.

I will be utilizing [Microsoft Hololens documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/hololens/) for reference.

However, I will also be using [tutorials](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/beginner-hololens-2-tutorials/) to get myself used developing using unity.


### Side Tasks

Other projects associated with this one will be:

- Developing a hololens application that could be used with the [Senseglove](https://www.senseglove.com/)

- Creating the application with more of a creative approach. 
    - This aligns with my personal goals. I hope to add in some of my own 3D models.
